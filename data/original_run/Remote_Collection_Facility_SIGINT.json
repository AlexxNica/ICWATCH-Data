Impact: Closed critical information gaps which allowed all-source analysts to develop a more complete picture of certain high-profile intelligence operations. • Refined a method by which critical bits of information were manually inputted into an agency-wide tool as a counter-method to inputting the material via the automated option.

    "description": "Supervised military analysts who provided real-time interpretation, advice, and assistance in SIGINT to the NMJIC Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI) and, ultimately, the J2. The team prepared a daily summary of significant SIGINT products gleaned from NSA and field reporting which was sent to members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, military services intelligence chiefs, and senior policy makers at the Pentagon. Provided technical guidance on intelligence reporting and classification issues for NMCC analytic desks, and oversaw distribution of SIGINT products to J2 target analysts. • Developed plans to standardize training for incoming team chiefs and the procedure for producing the daily summary of significant SIGINT products. Impact: Allowed the active duty military analysts to work effectively while substituting on different teams (a frequent practice with personal leave and required military training) and ensured the customer a high-quality intelligence summary regardless of the team producing it. • Initiated a new procedure for disseminating to the NMJIC DDI and Deputy Director for Operations, J3, time-sensitive intelligence information from the products of foreign intelligence partners. Impact: Made critical information from Second and Third Parties available to Department of Defense principals on a more-timely basis.",
