Customer Technology,Sr. Software Engineer,"my responsibilities were centered on two Web applications (Quick Cost Calculator (QCC) and Internet Shipping (UIS)). Specific accomplishments are listed belo Served as the Release Build Manager. Responsibilities included development environment support, running daily builds using a cron job (Ant task), patching software builds for maintenance releases, and component integration. Lead the design and implementation of allowing both QCC and Internet Shipping to share a user's session using Struts, Java and JSPs. This basically allowed the two applications to share data and made the site easier to use for our users. Lead the re-design efforts for the Quick Cost Calculator (QCC) in conjunction with www.ups.com site re-design. Created a schedule for QCC's redesign. The schedule spanned the entire development cycle (design, coding, testing and integration). Successfully implemented the new QCC design and the integration of the external QCC interface to the Page Generation Framework and the C-Clamp presentation layer using Struts, JSPs and Java. Mentored fellow developers on the implementation of the QCC design and the use of Model View Controller (MVC). User interaction was logged with the previously developed Reporter and Log4J. Acted as the primary interface to the Rating and Validation component (RAVE), Rating Component, Shipping Component and Internet Pickup for both QCC and IS. Performed load analysis testing using LoadRunner for QCC and the XML data provided by the reporter. XSL was used to transform the XML data into the LoadRunner tag based input. Designed, coded and tested a Reporter that collects statistics on QCC ranging from measuring time span hits to country specific queries. Framework was extended to measure real-time exceptions, servlet monitoring, and load balancing by extending Log4J. The output of the QCC reporter is in two formats, one for viewing (HTML) and one for further processing (XML).",2001-04-01,2004-03-03,http://www.linkedin.com/,[],[],[],David Magaha,Baltimore,Maryland Area,Computer Software,https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/themes/katy/ghosts/person/ghost_person_150x150_v1.png,[],"[{""name""=>""Cloudera Certified Hadoop Professionals"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2067206&goback=%2Enpp_david*5magaha%2F12%2F619%2Fa91&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Hadoop Users"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=988957&goback=%2Enpp_david*5magaha%2F12%2F619%2Fa91&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}]","[{""name""=>""Johns Hopkins"", ""description""=>""MS, Computer Science"", ""period""=>""1992 – 1994""}, {""name""=>""UMBC"", ""description""=>""BS, Computer Science, 2.9"", ""period""=>""1985 – 1991""}]",[],http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-magaha/12/619/a91?trk=pub-pbmap,,No,2015-05-02 01:44:08 +0200,"[{""name""=>""Hiram Hamlin"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hiram-hamlin/40/624/602?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Alberto Flores"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alberto-flores/1/922/771?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Allyson Hackley"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/allyson-hackley/44/aaa/6b1?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Kathleen D Madden"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kathleen-d-madden/39/42a/361?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Jeffrey Forloines"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeffrey-forloines/49/86b/553?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Brian Hildebrandt"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-hildebrandt/86/239/446?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Tom Hickok"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-hickok/89/418/b6a?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Lajuana Howard"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lajuana-howard/32/a46/b09?trk=pub-pbmap""}, {""name""=>""Harold Owen"", ""url""=>""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/harold-owen/1/223/326?trk=pub-pbmap""}]",2,public/uploads/pictures/ghost_person_150x150_v1.png,,,,,,,,8.0

Program Manager/Capture Manager,SRA International,"My first experience in the civilian sector, working as a program manager and AF SME. I was managing programs and working on proposals in bidding in areas of AF IT and NSA. After only about 7 months was handpicked to the the NETCENTS 2 Capture Manager. Building the teams to go after both the NetOps and Application Services opportunities. • Handpicked as Capture manager for the NETCENTS 2 bid, ($9B IDIQ) after only 7 months on the job—building the team and influencing the opportunity to ensure a Prime position • Business development activities within the AF in “branding” SRA as a company to be looked at and looked for in their contractual dealing. Provide access to key leaders with the AF, specifically AF/XC staff, AFCA, AMC, AETC, AFSPC and other MAJCOM A6s, the ANG, ESC, AFCYBER(P) and key leaders at 554 ELSW • Took over a troubled program and got it on track. Program needed leadership, strong direction, control and organization. Brought all these factors together and moved the program quickly from a “Yellow” to a “Green” • Diligently worked a number of RFP responses and worked as part of the team on others, lending technical and operational experience and expertise to the prop--turning tech speak into an operationally related discussion on how we would meet their mission requirements and deliver true combat capabilities",2006-12-01,2008-12-02,http://www.linkedin.com/company/3916?trk=ppro_cprof,"[""DoD"", ""Air Force"", ""Information Assurance"", ""Program Management"", ""Leadership"", ""Strategic Planning"", ""Management"", ""Security Clearance"", ""National Security"", ""Military"", ""Government"", ""Defense"", ""Government Contracting"", ""Command"", ""Integration"", ""PMP"", ""Top Secret"", ""FFP"", ""Telecommunications"", ""Military Operations"", ""Intelligence"", ""Federal Government"", ""Aerospace"", ""Process Improvement"", ""Operational Planning"", ""Defense Contracting"", ""Requirements Analysis"", ""Executive Management"", ""Resource Management"", ""Cross-functional Team..."", ""Project Management"", ""Strategic Leadership"", ""Policy"", ""Team Building"", ""Change Management"", ""Team Leadership"", ""Management Consulting"", ""Information Technology"", ""Proposal Writing"", ""Security"", ""Information Security"", ""IT Strategy"", ""IT Management"", ""Military Experience"", ""Knowledge Management"", ""Strategy"", ""SIGINT"", ""Business Development"", ""IT Service Management"", ""C4ISR""]",[],[],Mike Sinisi,Washington D.C.
