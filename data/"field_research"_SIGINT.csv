Federal Business Development Manager,Fugro Earthdata,"As the Federal Business Development Manager, I managed major initiatives and awards supporting the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) and Federal Programs. I developed strategic goals and relationships with respect to emerging customer needs, competitive positioning, requisite capabilities, and the tactical moves necessary to enable Fugro to capture opportunity in the market. Many of the programs required airborne EO, LiDAR, IfSAR and other remotely sensed phenomenology, with knowledge generated by the analysis, and exploitation of content, and derived products, and solutions to support on-shore (terrestrial), off-shore (maritime) and littoral (nearshore) requirements supported by Fugro's global capabilities. I identified and targeted leads, built customer and strategic industry relationships, while qualifying, researching, and developing business opportunities. I researched the internal and external environment in which Fugro, competitors and potential/existing clients operated, while building and maintaining a broad network of colleagues, partners and customers to share information and obtain prospects. I directed specific proposal activities, and participated in trades shows and conferences to sustain industry and client awareness of Fugro corporate services and capabilities. As the NGA Account Manager, I collaborated with colleagues on internal programs, coordinated and proactively maintained communications with the customer, participated in negotiation of contracts and contract changes, and served as liaison among project management and planning, project team, and line management, briefing NGA and Fugro Senior Management as required for capabilities, programs and target acquisitions.",2011-07-01,2014-10-03,http://www.linkedin.com/,,,Defense & Space,,,,,,"[""Strategic Planning"", ""Microsoft Office"", ""Program Management"", ""Proposal Writing"", ""Remote Sensing"", ""GIS"", ""Excel"", ""PowerPoint"", ""Planning"", ""Mentoring"", ""Budgeting"", ""Customer Relations"", ""Operations Management"", ""Team Building"", ""Change Management"", ""Project Planning"", ""Negotiation"", ""DoD"", ""Microsoft Excel"", ""Analysis"", ""Leadership"", ""C4ISR"", ""Management"", ""Government Contracting"", ""Project Management"", ""ArcGIS"", ""Customer Service"", ""Budgets"", ""Information Assurance"", ""LiDAR"", ""National Security"", ""Military"", ""Process Improvement"", ""ESRI"", ""Cartography"", ""Government"", ""Defense"", ""Geomatics"", ""Team Leadership"", ""Business Development"", ""Engineering"", ""Security Clearance"", ""Geography"", ""Integration"", ""Navy"", ""SIGINT""]",[],"[{""language""=>""French"", ""proficiency""=>nil}, {""language""=>""Italian"", ""proficiency""=>nil}, {""language""=>""Spanish"", ""proficiency""=>nil}]",Nancy McGee,Washington D.C.

Compost Ourtreach Coordinator,Washington State University,"The purpose of the program is to “close the loop” on a portion of the waste energy originating in the food system. Our community includes 1700 farms, most of them raising food. With curbside food and yard waste collection and composting facilities in the County, there is the opportunity to expand use of compost on farms. This program will conduct the applied research needed to validate use of compost on important local crops and create compost demonstration sites at up to 27 farms. Demand will be stimulated and a sustainable market created for returning waste food energy to local farms.",2012-04-01,2012-10-07,http://www.linkedin.com/company/166875?trk=ppro_cprof,http://www.wsu.edu,http://www.wsu.edu,Higher Education,Educational Institution,"236 French Administration Building
