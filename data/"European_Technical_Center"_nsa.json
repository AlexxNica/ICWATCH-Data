    "description": "• Recognized by the Commanding General European Regional Medical Command (ERMC) and presented with the Army Achievement Award for the following accomplishment: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Europe were preparing for a major Authorized Service Interruption (ASI) affecting one of the largest Technical Control facilities in Europe; they requested assistance with rerouting of a high priority circuit directly supporting ERMC (all medical facilities in the European theater and several down range clinics). I quickly engineered a solution and then lead a team consisting of DISA Europe engineers, TIMPO (DOD/MEDCOM) Lead network engineer and the Army controlled Systems Control facility to implement the solution. Within 24 hours the circuit and all medical IP traffic were rerouted to an alternate location. When the ASI was implemented no medical network traffic was affected and continuity of operations were maintained saving thousands of dollars in overtime for medical staff and possibly saving patents lives (per actual award citation) • After several enclave isolations of the Supreme Allied Headquarters Europe (SHAPE) staffs network; doing indepth research and troubleshooting; identified that the outages should not have isolated the SHAPE Enclave as there are redundant diversified DISA provided premise circuits connecting the enclave to two separate DISA Area routers. Created a detailed diagram, researched the routing protocol in use and identified the problem to DISA tier II IP Analysts who then confirmed that the enclave’s diversified connectivity was not configured correctly not taking advantage of the diversified links as was originally engineered. DISA Tier II reconfigured the enclave connections and routing; eliminating the isolations when the primary circuit fails • Identified network outages, disruptions, incidents or events that affect the status, operational state or performance of the Enterprise systems and the Theater network.",

Redesigned several “Untrusted” and uncontrolled downrange networks that were Demarking within the LRMC enclave. Designed, configured, and coordinated with the downrange commands and re-homed these uncontrolled, Untrusted networks out to a secured Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) Demarking on the Firewall, permitting for complete control (via access lists and stateful inspection) and isolation of these networks from the internal trusted enclave. • Performed a 100 percent Audit of all access lists and security rules on the OSSR and PIX Firewall, parsed hundreds of logs and verified and confirmed that over 100 blanket class B subnetted permit any statements were no longer needed and removed them from the ACLs. During this audit identified an asymmetrical routing problem with the DEERS network traffic which allowed privacy act information to be routed in the clear, coordinating and working with several agencies, NOSCs and the CONUS SPAWAR VPN team rerouted the sensitive traffic correctly through the secure network. • Administered and had complete responsibility for the entire LAN (with a 10000+ customer base) and a complete Secure (Tunneled) Wide Area Network (WAN) from the Out Side Screening Router (OSSR) to the Access Layer Switches.",
