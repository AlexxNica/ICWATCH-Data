"Comprehensive applications in the surveillance industry Behavior Analysis ,Face Recognition.",Overview of Smart Cities and the role of “Safe” in Smart Cities:,"Some of the other factors that drive Safer City projects are: a strong city economy, level of safety and security threat, availability of internet protocol, susceptibility to natural disasters, improved private and public partnership, and so on. ‘Safer City’ concept is expected to witness significant traction over the next few years as external/internal threat factors are given more importance by governments across the world. The higher the internal/external threat of terrorist attacks, the more probability there is of a city implementing a safer city project. In terms of adoption, the North American market has already seen some rapid progress after the 9/11 attacks. New York City is one of the most “surveilled” cities in the world with video surveillance cameras located at almost every junction, intersection, building, and public area in the city. Other major cities such as Tokyo, Los Angeles, and so on, are on the forefront in adopting safer city projects and related technologies. As critical assets in a city’s infrastructure, security technologies and solutions in future cities will play an important role in promoting better well-being and will support city operators to better cope with security and safety challenges. In the next 5-10 years, Frost & Sullivan expects safer city projects to become integral part of a city’s development schemes proposed by the respective governmen",2003-03-01,2005-06-02,http://www.linkedin.com/,,,Information Technology and Services,,,,,,"[""Senior software..."", ""Ruby, Rails, JavaScript..."", ""Applied analytical,..."", ""Marketing"", ""Security"", ""Enterprise Software"", ""Management"", ""Analysis"", ""Information Technology"", ""Analytics"", ""MySQL"", ""PHP"", ""Business Development"", ""Leadership""]",[],[],ben galor,Greater New York City Area,Greater New York City Area,https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/themes/katy/ghosts/person/ghost_person_150x150_v1.png,[],[],[],[],http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-galor/a/70b/452,"The emergence of smart technology is driving the creation of Safer Cities.

"Comprehensive applications in the surveillance industry Behavior Analysis ,Face Recognition.",Overview of Smart Cities and the role of “Safe” in Smart Cities:,"Some of the other factors that drive Safer City projects are: a strong city economy, level of safety and security threat, availability of internet protocol, susceptibility to natural disasters, improved private and public partnership, and so on. ‘Safer City’ concept is expected to witness significant traction over the next few years as external/internal threat factors are given more importance by governments across the world. The higher the internal/external threat of terrorist attacks, the more probability there is of a city implementing a safer city project. In terms of adoption, the North American market has already seen some rapid progress after the 9/11 attacks. New York City is one of the most “surveilled” cities in the world with video surveillance cameras located at almost every junction, intersection, building, and public area in the city. Other major cities such as Tokyo, Los Angeles, and so on, are on the forefront in adopting safer city projects and related technologies. As critical assets in a city’s infrastructure, security technologies and solutions in future cities will play an important role in promoting better well-being and will support city operators to better cope with security and safety challenges. In the next 5-10 years, Frost & Sullivan expects safer city projects to become integral part of a city’s development schemes proposed by the respective governmen",2003-03-01,2005-06-02,http://www.linkedin.com/,,,Information Technology and Services,,,,,,"[""Senior software..."", ""Ruby, Rails, JavaScript..."", ""Applied analytical,..."", ""Marketing"", ""Security"", ""Enterprise Software"", ""Management"", ""Analysis"", ""Information Technology"", ""Analytics"", ""MySQL"", ""PHP"", ""Business Development"", ""Leadership""]",[],[],ben galor,Greater New York City Area,Greater New York City Area,https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/themes/katy/ghosts/person/ghost_person_150x150_v1.png,[],[],[],[],http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/dir/Ben/Galor,"The emergence of smart technology is driving the creation of Safer Cities.

CEO,"Mobile Health One, Inc.","Mobile Health One is developing a cloud-based, HIPAA-secure mobile communication platform - MDChat™. MDChat™ directly connects healthcare providers with each other, with their patients, and with the information they need when they need it. MHO’s solution improves patient outcomes by accelerating communication and access to information while reducing errors and costs. MDChat™ enables secure, seamless communication and collaboration between healthcare providers, administrative personnel and patients. The system incorporates secure messaging, auto-patient tracking/physician notification, telehealth, remote monitoring of patient devices and wearables, and secure sharing of images and documents, 24/7 – all on the same mobile dashboard. MDChat On Call™ enables direct, 24/7 communication between patients and their doctor, or their doctor’s on-call medical staff, and administrative personnel (like the billing department) eliminating the need for a live operator. The system incorporates a web/mobile on-call scheduling system, a secure “chat” widget for the client web site and voice recognition/response to support direct communication between providers, patients, on-call staff, and administrative departments. MDChat On Call™ reduces live operator costs by up to 70% and ensures HIPAA compliance. MDView™ is a cloud-based radiology image viewing and sharing system for healthcare providers and patients. Users can access their own library of image studies and share them with any healthcare provider as needed. MDView™ eliminates the need to put image studies on discs, reducing costs by more than 80%. MHO is the first health IT company to perform real time identity verification in the cloud enabling system users to communicate on-demand with anyone, anywhere – regardless of where they work or what device(s) they carry.

Adept at vendor management, resource allocation, and expediting results, I consistently deliver timely and accurate results that exceed customer and client expectations. I earned the reputation as a qualified manager who leads by example, is a motivational leader, and effective trainer; I have directed organizations with hundreds of personnel. With a commitment to excellence, I establish high standards and expectations of my staff to deliver safety, quality, efficiency, productivity, cost containment, and compliance. I have successfully managed site logistics and compliance for hazardous material handling and hazardous waste sites, including the oversight of safety and security alerts to ensure employee compliance of established procedures. I began my career with the United States Army, where I earned increasing levels of responsibility by demonstrating my hard work and dedication to motivating teams and driving results.
