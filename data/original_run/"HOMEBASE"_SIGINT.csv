The higher the internal/external threat of terrorist attacks, the more probability there is of a city implementing a safer city project. In terms of adoption, the North American market has already seen some rapid progress after the 9/11 attacks. New York City is one of the most “surveilled” cities in the world with video surveillance cameras located at almost every junction, intersection, building, and public area in the city. Other major cities such as Tokyo, Los Angeles, and so on, are on the forefront in adopting safer city projects and related technologies. As critical assets in a city’s infrastructure, security technologies and solutions in future cities will play an important role in promoting better well-being and will support city operators to better cope with security and safety challenges. In the next 5-10 years, Frost & Sullivan expects safer city projects to become integral part of a city’s development schemes proposed by the respective governmen",,,,,,,,0
