Utilize the Technical Control Cell (TCC) and HUMINT Control Cell (HCC) Systems—SIGINT Excon, Near-Time Notional Gateway (NTNG), Intelligence Low Overhead Driver (iLOD), and HCC laptops—to run multi-intelligence exercises. Coordinate with team of three analysts to develop scenarios using the TCC and HCC capabilities. Script SIGINT and All-Source exercise reports and metadata. Script scenarios for interactive avatars using the HCC. Assist army SIGINT analysts on the use of various SIGINT tools and databases available with NTNG—which simulates tools available in the real world Real-Time Regional Gateway (RTRG) tool suite. Instruct soldiers on how to perform basic Tactical Questioning (TQ) techniques used in various operational settings including but not limited to: debriefings, key leader engagements (KLE), walk-ins, sources, and interrogations. Significant Accomplishments: • Part of first IEWTPT team—program wide—to successfully incorporate multiple intelligence disciplines into a single exercise. • Enhanced training value of IEWTPT exercises conducted on Ft. Carson through dedication to the mission.",

Developed roles and responsibilities for each analyst to ensure efficient and quality support was provided to the Prophet Operations Cell (POC) OIC and NCOIC. Ensured reports were accurate, relevant, and completed within deadlines. Encouraged teamwork to share knowledge and ideas. On a bi-weekly basis, briefed the Brigade S2 to keep him informed about recent HVI activity; to include: pattern of life (POL), current intelligence, and targeting recommendations. Received formal and informal Requests for Information (RFI) from the Prophet Operations Cell, the Jalalabad Fusion Center (JFC) Director, Cryptologic Support Team (CST) 17, and Battalion S2 commanders. Created tactical and strategic analytical products to answer each RFI. Products identified key insurgent nodes, HVI activity, POL, current intelligence, and provided recommendations to effectively use ISR collection. Authored more than 50 strategic SIGINT studies to support Brigade and Battalion Commanders. Created more than 20 Target Packages and JPEL nomination packages to support High Value Individual (HVI) Targeting Operations. Provided weekly assessments of HVI activity, which indicated trends, patterns, and most likely courses of action of each HVI network. Weekly assessments provided support to HVI network disruption operations and increased collaboration between the CIAT team, CST-17, POC analysts, and Battalion HUMINT analysts throughout the AO. Conducted area studies prior to clearance operations to support Brigade and Battalion intelligence requirements. Created route analysis studies to support Route Clearance Patrols (RCPs). RCP products identified Improvised Explosive Device hot-spots and provided assessments to counter enemy activity. Created analytical products that provided recommendations to effectively employ and use ISR collection assets to answer intelligence gaps.",

Analyzed the enemy's strengths, vulnerabilities, trends, and likely courses of action. Took initiative to standardize the DGS-2 SIGINT products by collaborating with the US Air Force SIGINT Cell NCOIC. Viewed as the “go to” SIGINT analyst. Provided mentorship to US Air Force and fellow SAIC SIGINT analysts. Developed and implemented advanced analytical concepts for short and long-term projects. Performed network analysis of terrorist communications to exploit terrorist command and control (C2) structures and identify current Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Oversaw the production of ISR-derived Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) tactical reporting that incorporated All-Source, SIGINT, and IMINT fused data. Promoted to Assistant Shift Lead and Lead SIGINT Analyst in September 2009. Responsible for the analytical production of ten analysts, which included four SIGINT analysts, four All-Source analysts, and two Imagery analysts. Monitored incoming Request for Support (RFS) from customers in Afghanistan. Tasked DGS-2 analysts and maintained awareness on each product.

I also operated systems that produce high-power electronic signals used to deceive and jam enemy electronic sensors, including those associated with electronically guided weapons. My responsibilities included: interpreting incoming electronic signals to determine their source and location; utilizing computer databases to analyze the electronic intelligence received, allowing accurate evaluation of weapon and detection system capabilities and limitations. My duties included: operating electronic detection and deception systems; evaluating intercepted radar emissions using computer databases to determine whether emissions originate from land based, surface ship, or airborne platforms; performing technical analysis of radar signals and systems in support of technical reports used by national level agencies plotting intercepted signals to determine effective defensive maneuvers in case of attack; tracking surface and airborne targets; defending the ship against inbound threats including anti-ship missiles; Routinely working with classified information and technical material in support of national security. - ASSESS AVAILABILITY OF NATIONAL ASSETS - IDENTIFY IW/COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS,AND INTELLIGENCE (C4I) CONNECTIVITY CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS - DRAFT EMCON BILL AND ESTABLISH PROCEDURES - DRAFT INPUTS FOR SHIP'S COMBAT SYSTEMS DOCTRINE - IDENTIFY IW ELEMENTS - RECOMMEND MODIFICATIONS TO SHIP'S MILDEC PROCEDURES - DIRECT EW MODULE RESOURCES - COORDINATE TACTICAL EW OPERATIONS - COORDINATE UNIT SUPPORT FOR MILDEC PLANS OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE WEAPONS SYSTEMS - DRAFT EA AND EW RANGE/SERVICES REQUESTS - IDENTIFY THREATS UTILIZING CURRENT INTELLIGENCE",

Developed, tested, altered, and put in to place the full implementation of the theater level electronic attack platform, Intrepid Tiger II, that would be used at the battalion and MEF level with the reduction of national assets affecting missions theater-wide. Successfully combined capabilities of electronic attack with national level SIGINT collection in order to geo-locate targets of interest during three separate missions. These were followed by in depth after action presentations to be used for mirroring in future operations, training oncoming collection managers, and justification to IJC on how the assets were used. Was the single point of contact for all collection matters focused or centered on any SIGINT target. This entailed being flexible and working with any available asset with any SIGINT collection capabilities on a moment’s notice. Continued to integrate theater net-centric geo-location into Radio Bn’s collection posture. Organized and directed various air assets for specific signal of interest targeting and high value individual targeting. Responsible for innovative and timely adjustments to compensate for systems being down while ensuring that the reporting was seamless. Troubleshot and came up with timely solutions to get collection assets back online after outage. Maintained master target tracker for all of 1st Radio Bn which consisted of an average of over 200 targets split among six different internal processing, disseminating, and exploitation groups. Kept the OIC and the entire chain of command abreast on all matters pertaining to collection, SIGINT targeting, and electronic warfare.",

This resulted in more clear, concise, and distributable products to be passed to the supported units. -Created a concise plan to best employ electronic attack and Radio Battalion operations congruently during a named operation for RCT-6 which consisted of researching the historical trends of the signals environment, the communication habits of the Afghans in the named area of interest, and knowledge of Radio Battalion’s mobile team capabilities that ultimately resulted in a plan as well as an easy way to adjust fire as the signals environment changes. -Worked to employ new and emerging technologies such as Raptor and Talon in order to streamline processes of collection, production, exploitation, and dissemination of any information pertinent to supported units. -With no training or prior experience, completely learned the Theater Net-Centric Geo-Location (TNG) concepts and tools from theory to operation, developed a standard operating procedure for the Radio Bn operator and analyst, and produced accurate results to the supported units.",

Utilized SIGINT tools in conjunction with ARCGIS to graphically depict insurgent patterns-of-life. Produced and reviewed over 1,000 daily threat assessments, weekly INTSUMs, and requests for information by utilizing OSINT, MASINT, and SIGINT tools. Trained and mentored a team of 20 personnel on essential analytical tools and tradecraft in order to strengthen the credibility and analytical rigor of intelligence products.",
