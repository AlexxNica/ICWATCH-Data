The enforcement actions taken by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (“FEHD”) have little deterrent effect. The Department seldom prosecutes shop operators for their act of illegal hawking on the street, and rarely seizes their merchandise that is obstructing the street. In those localities where shops are granted “tolerated areas”, for conducting their business outside their shops, FEHD fails to take rigorous enforcement actions against those shop operators further extending their business area well beyond the “tolerated areas”. The enforcement procedures of the Lands Department (“Lands D”) for tackling continual illegal occupation of Government land by shops are cumbersome and futile. Moreover, the difference in enforcement priorities of Lands D and the Buildings Department (“BD”) may sometimes lead to delay in the two departments’ joint operation.",

    "summary": "As soon as I re-entered academic realm, I took the advantage of bringing into research my considerable experience that I had gained in various managerial roles during 25 years of my career path in the banking industry. My practical skills enabled me to link multiple issues at a corporate level, including M&A, with banking regulation and to leverage them on new findings that contributed to further insights into regulatory reform and to the quest of its new aspects. A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia. SPECIALTIES: International economics Russian economics Regulatiory economics Regulatory risk and compliance Macroprudential regulation International financial integration Competition M&A and risk management Corporate strategy Organizational change Growth strategies Government, academic, and management consultancy Multilingual",

    "summary": "As soon as I re-entered academic realm, I took the advantage of bringing into research my considerable experience that I had gained in various managerial roles during 25 years of my career path in the banking industry. My practical skills enabled me to link multiple issues at a corporate level, including M&A, with banking regulation and to leverage them on new findings that contributed to further insights into regulatory reform and to the quest of its new aspects. A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia.

A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia.

    "summary": "As soon as I re-entered academic realm, I took the advantage of bringing into research my considerable experience that I had gained in various managerial roles during 25 years of my career path in the banking industry. My practical skills enabled me to link multiple issues at a corporate level, including M&A, with banking regulation and to leverage them on new findings that contributed to further insights into regulatory reform and to the quest of its new aspects. A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia.

    "summary": "As soon as I re-entered academic realm, I took the advantage of bringing into research my considerable experience that I had gained in various managerial roles during 25 years of my career path in the banking industry. My practical skills enabled me to link multiple issues at a corporate level, including M&A, with banking regulation and to leverage them on new findings that contributed to further insights into regulatory reform and to the quest of its new aspects. A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia.

    "summary": "As soon as I re-entered academic realm, I took the advantage of bringing into research my considerable experience that I had gained in various managerial roles during 25 years of my career path in the banking industry. My practical skills enabled me to link multiple issues at a corporate level, including M&A, with banking regulation and to leverage them on new findings that contributed to further insights into regulatory reform and to the quest of its new aspects. A published writer, I have addressed banking regulation reform in US, UK, EC, Russia, and other G20 countries as well as M&A in the banking sector. My endeavor to bring my expertise and knowledge to wider readership resulted in my appearance in the Global Risk Regulator, January 2014 issue (a monthly publication from the Financial Times) where I commented on challenges and perspectives of banking regulation reform in Russia. During my banking industry career I developed banking structures that ensured global success. Directing high-profile integrations during multinational branch transitions and openings, I streamlined reporting, improved cost control and increased performance, growing market share and ensuring compliance in highly regulated environments. Driving performance in spite of 30% downsizing, I directed over $250M in global deals for a giant banking enterprise. With expertise in banking regulatory integrity for M&A processes, I managed to apply a balanced approach in directing operations in volatile global markets. My MBA is from the University of Liverpool Management School and I earned my PhD and MS in Finance & Banking at the Financial University, Russia.

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

    "summary": "Dr Monir Hossain Moni, who as a research-active faculty member has worked for the Department of Political Science at Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Dhaka over more than a decade, is now a Research Professor & Director of the Program on Global Japan Studies at Division of Asian & International Affairs of Asia Pacific Institute for Global Studies (APIGS) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While Dr Moni holds first division/class all through his educational life, he with the highest distinctions obtained his MSS in Political Science (‘first class first’ position) and BSS (Honors) in Political Science (‘first class second’ position) from University of Dhaka. Besides his higher degrees awarded by the two Tokyo-based most prominent universities in Japan under the Japanese Government MEXT (Monbukagakusho) scholarship program during 7 years (the longest period of MEXT’s record), Dr Moni has held a number of international research scholarships and fellowships. Solely by his personal capacity and initiative, he has also accomplished a series of top-quality research projects, by continuous successes in receiving competitive funding from Japan’s leading grant-making organizations. His two Japan-related book-length publications have been awarded generous financial supports from the Tokyo-based Japan Foundation as well. Dr Moni is not only a dedicated scholar with excellent research track record, but also one of the most prolific Asian authors who has extensively and valuably contributed to international peer-reviewed journals. Several of his highly-authoritative, intellectually-stimulating and wonderfully-illuminating pieces have also appeared in encyclopedias produced by the world’s largest academic publishers like Routledge, Sage, Praeger/Greenwood, etc. In addition, while many international refereed journals have utilized the expertise of Professor Moni as a prudent reviewer, his solicited book reviews have been published in a number of globally reputed journals.",

To facilitate the effective engagement in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, communities and organisations. My Achievements: I have maintained and advanced the following network arrangements within this position: Far Northern Child Protection Newsletter Improved communication among NGO's and government agencies working with children, young people and their families across the Far North. Cardwell Shire Child Protection Planning and Partnership Forum coordinated meeting with community-based and state government service providers with a focus on child protection issues. The discussions covered an overview of the Child Protection Continuum, the role of the Department of Child Safety. Children at Risk Action Network (CARAN) The Far Northern Zonal Director of Child Safety, in partnership with other government departments came together to consolidate policies and funding advice, that allowed partners to identify funding opportunities and improved existing funding resources in the delivery of child protection. CARAN joint planning, lead to a strategic operational overview for it’s members in the delivery of child protection service. Douglas Shire Planning and Partnerships Forums Local service representatives (2 in Mossman and 1 in Port Douglas) participated in forums to work together to identify and respond to local child protection priorities within their communities. the outcome of these forums was the \"Douglas Shire Child Protection Week, Family fun day\", during Child Protection Week September 8th to the 16th of 2007. Ten service agencies got involved in promoting their services and coordinating activities in raise awareness of protecting children in the Douglas Shire Community.",

It was through my involvement in Transition The Grove Inc that I was selected as a local community representative to go to the Mackay Summit for The QLD Plan; and it was for Transition The Grove Inc that we had a marquee and I was a speaker at Hillbrook Sustainability Day. One move this year has been to work much more closely on a North-West Brisbane sustainable communities basis with similar groups in the region (Transition The Gap, Transition Enoggera, St John's Wood Sustainability, Samford Futures) and I've been doing what I can to facilitate this happening. Close friendships and support at the leadership level has emerged with people like Wally Wight (Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas), Chris and Joan Wright (Transition The Gap and Yooralla St Community Garden), Sue Cooke and Sandra Bayley (St John's Wood Sustainability, The Greens, Beyond Zero Emissions), and Howard Nielsen (Samford Futures). Our most recent event was a film night of YouTube videos, held at Ferny Grove State High School. This offered a good selection of top links that we had identified for people to choose. As usual I arranged a generous supper for us all to indulge in while we socialised, watched the videos and then discussed them afterwards. This format is very rewarding. I keep the membership database, and register new members which at the moment number around 110. Having communications enabled through the website makes it possible to target e-newsletters precisely by interest group, and I've prepared a number of these over the year. I was elected President in October 2013.",

    "description": "A team of two of us read the news from The Courier Mail and The Australian for 2 hours one morning each week (6-8am). This includes the weather and the funeral notices. It has been tremendous for building confidence in voice, and working radio processes. After an initial audition, we received some training from a specialist voice trainer. We read the articles from the newspaper in full, which can require considerable voice control for very long articles. It also demands excellent ability to read fluently and accurately grasp the sense of the words to provide voice inflection and appropriate pace for listeners to be able to follow. This is a regular commitment that requires reliability to turning up by 5:30am and meeting all the deadlines. We have formed fond relationships with others in the 4RPH team, and delight in the annual 4RPH party. Especial thanks to Nadine who is so precious to work with, and to Ed Richardson who gives his heart and soul to making the station work.",

We've shared pulling together as a community through 3 major bushfires this season. The whole community submitted development applications working together.

    "description": "3 representatives were invited from each electorate to attend the planning summit in Mackay. I was invited to attend because of my wide involvement in the local community. We flew up and spent a very full day brainstorming with 500 others (including all the State politicians and nearly all the QLD mayors) to come up with 6 questions to put to the citizens of Queensland to discuss and formulate directions for Queensland future for 30 years. We have also been having community meetings in the Ferny Grove electorate. I addressed the audience at the first one to help provide an overview. After Mackay, the three of us who attended provided briefings to the full meeting before we all got into discussing the questions. These discussion sessions have been richly productive.",

    "description": "I facilitated 2 school holiday workshops for children and teens, funded by BCC. These were 2-hour workshops. The first started with looking at the uses of various herbs (culinary, medicinal, skin care,...). Then each child got a big pot and was shown how to work safely with potting mix, and they had lots of herb seedlings to choose 5 from to plant. Some got more adventurous and planted in broccoli boxes on a larger scale. I had propagated lots of herbs from seedlings and cuttings in the weeks prior to the workshop. We finished up all having herb teas. The mothers loved the whole workshop and joined in too. Each child went home with a herb pot. The worm farm workshop demonstrated 3 types of worm farms (worm tower, single tier and double tier with tap and drain). Lots of instruction on hygeine. We started off with acrylic paints each painting our own icecream container with \"Worm Food\". Then set up worm farms, and made the more complex ones from supplied pieces. I'd put together all the necessary stuff, and came prepared with handfuls of worms from my own worm farms as starters. Also samples of foods that worms love, and foods they hate. Then we made worm juice and talked about how to use it to fertilise the garden. I had handouts to give out too. I was asked by Margaret Burman, the PR Manager at the shopping centre, to run the workshops, and liaised with her to set things up in one of the courtyards. I have a Blue Card for working with children. It definitely helped to have mums come along too (think they were attracted by the topics) and a staff member from Piccabeen (they applied for the funding) came along too.",

Important to be festive and welcoming to set the tone for everyone to have a great festival. Over the 3 days I worked 3 five hour shifts. Later, as part of The Planting, I joined in with work groups to do some serious weeding around previously planted trees, and some serious mulch spreading (like tonnes of it!). The results looked good at the end. Did 2 sessions.",

We beat the previous world record and took it from the 6000s to the 7000s. Loved the challenge. I downloaded the music weeks beforehand and practised daily. Went to a preliminary practice session at the Southbank Piazza. Turned up bright and early on the day and got my t-shirt and found my spot in the stadium. Yes, and we performed all the pieces in style. We also did a Mexican wave in sound!",

Margaret Burman from Ferny Grove Shopping Village asked for our support, and I wrote a letter. They were successful. We were then asked down to the shopping centre to have our photo taken with local police and school principals for North West News. The grant was for security cameras for the shopping centre, and I was very aware of how much Margaret had achieved in reducing vandalism around the shopping centre, and was very happy to support her.",

Attending this year's symposium on population organised by SPA was a real highlight. Particularly outstanding was the talk on Peak Mining (a concept I hadn't previously appreciated). Bruce Taylor from Buderim also caught my interest with his set of references he's put together on contraceptive plants, with the goal of getting them readily available into kitchen gardens across the world. I encouraged him to work with the global Permaculture network. I've been regularly attending the Sustainable Population Australia meetings at Toowong Library, and have formed the highest respect for the intelligence and quality of knowledge that members bring to discussions there. Thanks particularly to Jane O'Sullivan.",

    "description": "With some trepidation went back to my first university which filled such a huge part of my life from aged 16 to 30, both as a student through my Bachelor of Science in mathematics and statistics, Bachelor of Arts in psychology, and postgraduate computing studies; as a resident of St Catherine's College; as an academic wife with all the close association with university life that involved, having met my husband at St George's College; then tutoring in the Mathematics Department, and working in the Reid Library. Stayed at St Catherine's which has changed hugely. The University is looking wonderful, and it felt very right to be there and be part of the whole event. One eerie moment when I went on a tour of the Senate rooms where I'd never been before and we all randomly sat ourselves down at the seats and I was advised I was in the Vice-Chancellor's seat. Always felt that was a role I should have held in another life. The nearest I actually came was working closely in university administration at Murdoch University. I do truly feel a child of this university (by the pond at the Reid Library, next to the stage watching Chrissie Parrot ballet, reflecting on exams & concerts past in Winthrop Hall), but now, also, the university's motto (Seek Wisdom) resonates with me and I feel in the wisdom age of my life, and able to reflect on how well the university is doing it's job. Superbly in building a place of extraordinary beauty and wealth and culture. Less so as a leader in engineering for addressing the profound challenges of climate change in today's world. Carmen Lawrence and Geraldine Doogue - thank you for your leadership as women.",

Deb Blakely, Community Nutritionist, set up this excellent network to coordinate providers of food relief services in the region. There are estimated to be up to 90,000 people in the region under some food stress. Previously isolated groups in the community provided food relief, but this network enabled them to coordinate together, source and share bulk food more systematically, identify services available, identify areas of need, and raise the profile of food insecurity as an issue. Through my intense work in the local community identifying groups and individuals actively working in this community, I was able to put four groups in touch with the Network, and some benefited considerably by linking in. I also worked to raise concerns about the nutritional status of food served through our school tuckshops, linking it in to the widespread concern in the health sector about obesity and Type II diabetes epidemic.",

From there on it has been a simple matter to have the bank statements available and present the annual financial report at the AGM. I've been active in an ongoing way with this group, and have helped with garden working bees (Patricks Rd Preschool); organising and talking with the public at an Open Day for a proposed community garden site in a local park; scouting around parks and vacant land for possible suitable sites; attending meetings; and meeting with the Moreton Bay Regional Council to discuss licensing requirements for use of a piece of land by the Bunya Dog Park. Developed close working friendships with Jo Barkworth (Secretary), Kathi Sanderson, Zeki Murad.",

    "description": "After participating with Di in this group for some years, she asked me to take over as group leader. I had to find the group a new home in a central location. Initially I arranged for us to meet at Albany Creek Library which we did for a couple of years, then we moved to Ferny Hills Guides Hut for a while, before settling on a meeting room in Compton Gardens, Aspley. I had to get copies of U3A insurance papers and manage keys for the use of the Guides Hut, and arrange for payment for hire of facilities with the U3A Treasurer. The group runs using a process that is very effective in developing very deep trust and closeness among members, and their writing all evolves to uncover and share very rich stories of their lives. We each write 1800 words before the meeting, and then listen while each reads out what they have written. This is followed by doing a writing exercise from a book in the session. I liaise with the U3A Newsletter Editor to get appropriate updates about the group in each quarterly newsletter. Annually there is a U3A Open Day which a couple of us attend and have a table where interested people can come and ask us about the group and what we do, and sign up to join if they want to. After this session, I usually send out an email explaining processes. There is also an annual Tutors Morning Tea which includes discussing ideas to improve the general operation of classes. One year I arranged with the group to record the sessions, and then, after carefully editing the sound track, I produced a CD (a copy for each member of the group) of our readings. Each year we organise a Christmas luncheon where we bring a plate to share, and a present to share in a Secret Santa, and wine. This is always a wildly successful event.",

At the time I was producing my own radio program on Radio YYY, and I took the opportunity to interview some of the people who participated in the Clean Up Australia Day event, including the Wahminda Scouts. The following year we joined a group someone else coordinated, and spent some happy hours climbing up and down Creek banks collecting difficult to reach items of rubbish, filling our sacks. It is an opportunity to get up close and personal with the environment, and leave it the better for our having been. Love it. This year we joined with the Northern Catchments Group and cleaned up the bottom (sea) end of Kedron Brook at Nudgee Beach, roaming through mangroves and shallow water in light rain, but collected lots of rubbish and had a great picnic all together afterwards. Happy times stuff. Took good photos to put in newsletters.",

    "description": "This year was our second time as stall-holders at Hillbrook Sustainability Day (the first in 2011). This year the stall was a combined effort with 2 marquees for sustainability groups operating in north-west region of Brisbane (Transition The Grove Inc, Transition The Gap, Transition Enoggera, St John's Wood Sustainability, and Samford Futures). We have put together a good lot of equipment for these events, including display boards and tea and coffee equipment. This time we also set up five small tables with chairs, lace table cloths and vases of flowers to create a cafe environment. We had prepared a survey of questions on sheets of A4 paper for people to sit down and write down their answers. I walked around inviting people to come and sit down and answer the questions. This was very successful, and we got an excellent response with careful thoughtful answers to the questions, collecting 50 completed surveys easily. The day is a marvellous networking opportunity, and I knew many of the people on the stalls and there were lots of good conversations. I was one of the first speakers of the day, and spoke on 'Sustainable Communities\" (what is happening in North West Brisbane, and what goes into making a community sustainable). I drew quite a reasonable crowd, and got the program off to a good start for the day. The topic was well received.",

    "description": "I take the minutes (use my little Netbook and I can type very fast and take down what is talked about very accurately and in detail). I get the minutes out by email to the members straight after the meeting. Works well. Working with this group is very valuable to helping me understand social justice issues. We cover a lot of topics (prisoners, refugees, homelessness, Aboriginals,...) We have organised a number of fund-raising nights, and also a very successful local forum on the conditions for prisoners in Queensland. For this I provided contact details to enable representatives from all the local churches to be invited. At Christmas, three of us took on Christmas shopping for presents for children of local prisoners. Through the Social Justice Committee I have also attended other forums in Brisbane on social justice topics, including one coming up on the Queensland Plan. This group has grown very close and strong, and it constantly amazes me how much a group of volunteers can achieve working steadily and patiently to grow in understanding of issues. We recently completed a big survey of the attitudes of the Catholic community of north west Brisbane's priorities in regard to social justice. This was an excellent project. I went along to the church one Sunday morning to announce the survey. We have been involved in a number of events with the Aboriginal community locally. Firstly, we held a Kuringbah Workshop on approaching Aboriginal history through drama. Very moving for all of us involved in the day. Then we attend the National Sorry Day celebration and breakfast in Teralba Park. I helped with a fruitful forum \"Our community - history (Aboriginal) & background\" for local & State Aboriginal leaders to meet with us. A wonderful team of people to work with. All heart, and truly committed",

    "description": "Volunteering for Woodford Folk Festival is a wonderful thing to do. I wanted a simple role that I could be sure of getting. Garbology is also important to me, because I value cleanliness and tidiness, and find it easy to be meticulous about spotting rubbish and picking it up. It is a great role because we are out on the streets at 6am when only the workers are there and there is a real sense of belonging. We get the place cleaned up perfectly to start the day, then for the rest of the day and evening keep a spot check on our territory while roaming around enjoying the Festival. We have special tools to pick up rubbish, and they are fun to use. Many people want them! Sometimes we find money. Many people thank us for doing a good job. I like to dress up for the role, in the spirit of the Festival. I'm one of the volunteers who were there right through the flood year. And came back! Get to talk to some wonderful people while walking around picking up rubbish. I was very proud last year when we got special mention after the Fire Event evening. There was NO rubbish at all. I'd been one of the team quietly moving among the crowd all evening keeping the whole Festival site spotless. It rubs off and people simply stop rubbishing Woodford, which is great. We work in pairs, and have a great team spirit. Thanks to Amie Green, Gino Martola",

    "description": "I was a member of this 'think tank'-style group meeting fortnightly for some years. Members were a broad cross-section of deep thinking, socially aware people, with a strong representation among tertiary educators and consultants which coordinate planning and learning workshops. One (or sometimes two) people would take responsibility for leading the meeting on a topic of their choosing. I led quite a few of the meetings (?a dozen). The format begins with a shared meal in one of our homes, which the person leading the evening would also take responsibility for arranging. Then we would begin by sharing briefly what we had been doing in our lives since the previous meeting (a professional reflection time). Then we'd go on to spend one and a half to two hours in workshop-type discussion around the topic, led by the person in charge of the evening. This person also decides on the format and type of workshop activities and questions that may be used. Most recently, I ran a session of The Queensland Plan (filling the group in on the processes used in the Mackay Summit to develop 6 futures-focused questions for community discussion; then facilitating group discussion around the questions and the process using a much broader list of questions I had since put together as worth thinking about). Prior to this I have run evenings on ethics (in collaboration with Paul Wildman); Transition Towns, co-counselling, and other topics. Thanks to the wonderful thinkers I have met and worked with through Hot Futures: Bob Dick and Camilla Andrews, Paul Wildman, Ian Plowman, Pam Swepson, Jim and Jan Prentice, Neil Davidson, Oscar Metcalfe, Andrew Wilford (Wilf), David Wyatt, Rebecca Doyle, Robert Maxwell, Mac Campbell, Ron Stanton, Meriel Stanger, Chris Wright.",

    "description": "This is a twice-yearly event, and I love volunteering at it. The roles involve sitting at a check-out counter and processing thousands of books (hundreds of customers) through the check-out. Over the years pricing methods have changed, and got simpler. I used to find it an excellent workout for the mathematical brain having to add up the price (in the high priced section) of great stacks of books in my head. No calculators! I can do it very fast. We have wonderful conversations with the customers about the books they have found and treasure, and with the other team members who we get to know quite well over the years. Lifeline Bookfest volunteers are very loyal! I always spend much more than I can afford buying books too. Lifeline is an outstanding employer of volunteers, with very clear instructions and processes, the best biscuits for morning tea, great respect for their volunteers, and the best Christmas party imagineable. Thanks heaps Anastasia Magriplis. We love you.",

    "description": "I've been a Servas Host since around 1990, and enjoy having travellers come to stay in our home from all over the world. They come for 2 nights, and are provided with a comfortable bedroom/bathroom facilities, and usually all their meals while they are home. Sometimes we take them sightseeing on drives around SE QLD. If I am doing something in the community, I'll take them along too. Servas travellers find us through our entry in the Australian Servas Host book. We usually pick them up from the station. Typically I'll provide hospitality and friendship for about half a dozen Servas travellers (sometimes singles, sometimes couples). For the last year I've been QLD Travel Officer, and that includes being the QLD representative on the Servas Australia Board. Went down to Melbourne for the Board meetings and AGM earlier this year. It involves getting aware of the rules for good governance and applying them. Board meetings prove to be long and weighty! Since then we've had a Board meeting by Skype and that was most successful. As Travel Officer, I receive applications from people wanting to become Servas Travellers. I supply them with all the necessary forms, arrange Hosts to interview new people, then process all the completed forms sent back to me. (Quite like making a passport). Also have to keep track of payments and put in regular financial statements. It is an administrative position that requires reliability in dealing with people, as well as sorting out issues. Mistakes not welcome as this would muck up people's travel! I enjoy the job, and it has brought me into much closer contact with people travelling, and enjoy sharing their plans. QLD has quarterly Host Gatherings, and we have had several of them at our house. A big crowd turn up and bring a plate to share a meal. Always fun. Thanks particularly to Jean & Ben Spencer, Norma Nicholson, Gwen Gregg, and Mae Harding for support in encouraging me to become Travel Officer and settling me into the role.",

I had to drive down to the airport, and pick up performers and bring them back to Woodford. I made several trips to the airport. It involved a lot of waiting, and mobile phone calls to identify where the people to be collected were, and to meet up with them successfully. Chatting with them in the car on the way up was the rewarding part. I didn't see much of The Planting though. My prime skills for this job were my reliability as a good driver, and ability to negotiate timetables and airports effectively. Strictly no stuff-ups.",

    "description": "After producing 76 hours of weekly one-hour programs, I called a halt, but this was a massive experience for me. First up, Mike Baguley taught me how to record radio, and how to work with sound tracks. Gradually I learned, then got my own good quality microphone and editing software and put together the programs from home. Let's say it took absolutely heaps of work. Basically it took a full week to produce a one-hour program each week. I used a number of approaches. I would read massive amounts of quality journalism each week (whole newspapers from cover to cover) and digest them and bring together ideas from multiple sources into an analysed, integrated whole with my own approach. Always, I sought to bring it back to how it was relevant locally. I was always on the lookout for local stories and people to interview. Never a shortage. I did interviews most weeks, and got some very good ones. A few scoops with big-name people, but some of the best are 'unknowns' who'd bring tears to your eyes. A lot of roving-mike work. Back in my study I did hours and hours of close editing work. People were usually delighted with the results. Interviewing opened many local doors. Then had to source about 6 song tracks per week suitable for the topics discussed. Each week was very very different topics. Found some great songs, but it stretched my musical knowledge heaps. My programs are all archived on the Transition The Grove Inc website, and I plan to sort them more for better ease of searching. My confidence in preparing and presenting a point of view grew enormously through this process which was a tremendous life experience.",
