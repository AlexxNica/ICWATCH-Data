    "description": "Remote Operating Facility NSA/CSS Certified Signals Development Center (SDC) analyst, satisfying customer interests through collection and geolocation of emerging or relatively unknown technologies. Gained a working knowledge of satellite geometry and positioning need to work successfully in an Overhead environment. Processed the signals I collected. Successfully transitioned to the SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Division's Discovery Center to work projects designed to exploit or further exploit specific targets. Was instrumental in the collection and geolocation of an extremely hard to find target. This effort included manually sifting through hundreds of hours of collection. This led to me becoming the Mission Support Driver for all related technologies. I managed and analyzed most collect for these technologies and then I would provide the customers with intelligence they requested. As an MSD I was also responsible for developing new missions in search of unknown or undeveloped related technologies. I am currently working a group of targets; providing the collection operators with a well developed CONOP and keeping a close relationship with the customers. The customers have reported this is best data they have received since the targets were first discovered.",

    "description": "Worked as lead software integration and testing engineer. This includes testing newly created software to ensure the application operates according to requirements set forth by the customer. These requirements were maintained in DOORS software. Testing utilized manual testing and utilizing Load Runner to verify functionality for over 5000 users, and using UNIX and SQL scripting to verify database functionality. These UNIX and SQL scripts were developed by myself and my developers and testers. Regression testing was accomplished using automated testing where applicable. I was starting the implementation of Selenium automated testing software when I was laid off. Includes all required documentation to annotate problems or malfunctions that occur while operating software; and upon completion of test, create Software Test Reports and Software Test Description documentation which were accomplished using Clear Case and ClearQuest. Responsible for providing Basis of Estimate (BOE) for new Request for Change (RFC) and Engineer Change Proposals (ECP) for the Integration and Test department. Served as the lead for training development and implementation for Boeing Proprietary Programs. Training included creation and implementation of course curriculum including slide presentations, lesson plans, course schedules, instructor qualification/certification. Completed, and certified, in Earned Value Management.",

The other team is the Build team whose responsibility is creating any new development. We use a hybrid version of Scrum to manage both team but the Run team is slowly drifting towards a Kanban like style. My role for both teams are management of resource allocations and facilitating Cadence activities. I help to isolate the teams from undue external interference that help to keep them a solid group of high performing stars. Due to my many years here I also am asked to fulfill the role of SME for many aspects of the data warehouse.",

I have been a major contributor to the development of NRL's Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) capability since 1981 when I was employed by Quest Tech which was acquired by CACI in 1996. I am the resident historian for the Specific Emitter Identification program at NRL. I have written signal processing, GUI, and relational database interface software. In addition to my programming duties, I managed a contract for CACI with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. During my twelve years of service I have been responsible for directing my staff and handling performance reviews, interfacing with the government project manager and the contract officer's representative (COR), and managing the writing of the proposals. In the twelve years at CACI I have worked mainly in Visual C++ using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and the Standard Template Library (STL). I also worked with the SQL databases MySQL and SQLite, and earlier with an Access type database using Codebase. I also did graphics work using the Pro-Essentials graphics package, and database management work using Rogue Wave's Objective Grid package. Through my work at NRL; I have had contact with the SEI community in general. This included supporting installation and training at Navy and NSA sites around the globe. It also included consultation and system integration with General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin.",

In the same period my software development moved from a DOS based system using Microsoft FORTRAN and a flat home-grown database to Visual C++ and a relational database. I was also became a key person in the installation and training of NRL-SEI during that period.

    "description": "• Conducted Rational Rose, UML design and extensive Java Swing development for two Java desktop application components. Implemented an Object to RDBMS/JDBC mapping layer to produce generic, reusable application services. • Developed UNIX shell scripts that ingest Oracle SQL table build scripts and generate Java classes that map to Oracle database tables. • Designed and developed a Java 2D image processing tool for displaying and editing raw IEEE 32 bit float and JPEG imagery for a DARPA project • Designed and developed a C++, X/MOTIF, multi-threaded, real-time, GIS translator for a multiple sensor MTI tracker. This n-tiered, GIS translator receives a data stream from a Virtual Reality-Link (DIS bus), and then conducts time/spatial filtering and fusion of radar MTI and DTED shadow blockage data with identified off board observations, into directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structures. • Designed and developed an X/MOTIF, TCP/IP, multi-threaded client controller to the GIS data stream translator. The GUI is extensible, allowing new widgets to be added without recompiling source code. • Designed and developed a VisiBroker, C++/CORBA server for a multiple sensor tracker/fusion DARPA project that utilizes skip list, LRU object management, and persistent object storage/retrieval. • Designed and developed Geoidal and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), C++ classes that memory map data for fast access by a kinematic MTI tracker for a GIS system. Uses cubic spline and bilinear Z interpolation. • Designed and developed an n-tiered, X/Motif, C++, message parsing class that interfaces with the ERIM COTS, Waterfall+ GIS package, via a TCP/IP socket stream. This GIS software is used in the exploitation of EO/SAR imagery data. • Developed an algorithm that can automatically resolve the row, column dimensions or raw IEEE 32 bit float imagery (no header row/column information). • Designed and developed a generic C++ interface to the ObjectStore 5.1 database",

    "description": "Designed and wrote a Particle Distribution Blending and Surface Area program that will calculate a specified or optimized blend of up to 8 particle distributions, as compared to a Farris, Furnas or specified particle distribution. The optimum blend is calculated by setting the derivative of the RMS error function with respect to the percent of each distribution equal to zero, and then solving n simultaneous linear equations. An RMS error is computed as a measure of conformity of the new composite distribution to the ideal distribution. Surface area calculations are also reported. This software is a strategic ARC tool. Designed and wrote a Statistical Environmental Database for the analysis and storage of environmental soil, water and air field data. It calculates a Behrens-Fisher t-test for significant variation from a baseline. Time-trend regression analysis is also conducted. Database search/retrieval and table plotting are also provided. The software saves Atlantic Research Corporation 50K+ in annual statistician consulting fees. Designed and wrote software for calculating the oxygen/fuel ratio of solid rocket propellants containing metallic species, by solving a series of simultaneous linear equations for the oxygen/fuel ratio requested. Solid rocket propellant chemist involving the processing of rocket propellant formulations with acceptable ballistics and physical properties. IR&D syntheses of Methylene Dioxyammonium Dinitrate (DOAN), 3-Nitro-1,2,4-Triazol-5-One (NTO), and Hexabenzylhexaazaiso-wurtzitane. Performed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) research as a propellant chemist, developing a Kinetic Energy Weapon (KEW 2.5) in a specially built laboratory. Principle technical coordinator for three material and component aging programs for the Trident Missile Post Boost control system.

    "description": "While going through my MBA program in 2008, I became friends with a classmate who was a Real Estate Broker in the Orlando area; Steve Merchant. Since I had owned investment property in upstate New York since 2005, and had a roommate that was considering the short sale of his home, I worked with Steve through the process of becoming a realtor. My primary motivation in becoming a realtor was educational. Since short sales and foreclosures were so rampant after the real estate crash in 2008, the market had a bit of a \"wild west\" feel to it that I found interesting. In the end, I got my roommates house sold, and I learned a lot about how non-traditional real estate transactions are negotiated and executed.",

I was made responsible for the Technical Reference Manual of the initial device and carried it through the initial process and continued through early revisions. With the original device entering the customer prototyping and product development phase (in the later part of 2006) I took on direct customer support responsibilities along with level 2 activities (solving issues posed by T.I. Field Applications Engineers). In late 2007 I was given responsibilities for additional technical documents and by early 2008 I was put in charge of all the technical documents of the (by then) family of devices, while at the same time continuing to work with customers. During the spring of 2008 the decision was made to take the family of devices 'public' and I worked with the designers and T.I.'s legal staff to resolve intellectual property issues after which I revised the technical documents and had them uploaded to T.I.'s externally accessable Web Pages. By mid 2008 I was reporting directly to T.I. management in France and developing schematic designs for suggested customer designs.",

Its seed money was from some technologists that came out of Raytheon and Texas Instruments. They were depending on people being able to work without being immediately paid in the hope that funding would later come through (there was also the offer of stock if the company went public). I reported to the Chief Technical Officer and worked on RF path studies in support of his technical presentations to potential investors. Right as phase one of my work was completing a position opened-up at Texas Instruments and I took it as I had bills to pay. (Entre Networks closed down in Dec 2004.)",

I reported to the WLAN Test/Verification Manager and about 30 % of my work came directly from the R&D Manager. Once an I.C. was confirmed as being operable (in Santa Rosa) it was shipped to me for testing. In addition I was responsible for design issues such as RF power control and early stages of the WLAN antenna characterization effort. (This position in Dallas was eliminated when TI bought a company near San Francisco in July 2003 and all WLAN Engineering was then moved to California.)",

As a result I spend much of my time evaluating a satellite modem technology for terrestrial applications (Raytheon had laid off a small satellite modem development group and through my boss I was asked to investigate the hardware to see if it could be used). There was also still life in the adaptive beamforming work and I worked with the realtime software developers to provide signal analysis of commercial cellular signals (in support of this effort I installed an active rooftop antenna array). After our manufacturing group (they'd been building an amplified antenna for a major cellular manufacturer) was laid off, and with the Engineering team beginning to drift off to other companies, I decided that I'd better do the same.",

    "description": "This was my first job out of college and it still makes me smile. The only thing that could have made it better would have been to come along a few years earlier so that I could have worked directly for Collins Radio (they were acquired by Rockwell-International in the mid-1970s). I traveled all over the U.S. installing, turning-up and trouble-shooting Rockwell-Collins digital microwave radios. I worked on mountain tops in New Mexico and Wyoming, saw the Northern Lights from Wisconsin, swung from a bosun's chair part-way up an AT&T tower in the hills of eastern Kentucky, and travelled much of the Ozark Mountains. A trip to Caracas enabled me to fix the digital control system used by the Venezuelan Oil Ministry on their Collins microwave radio system. My boss once asked me \"Would you go to Khartoum?\" but I was enough of a student of history and geography to politely demur (I'm no Gordon). If it needed to get done ... as a Collins Field Engineer I got to do it. (I've 'swept' waveguide, tuned I.F.s, aligned microwave paths, and, on a back road in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, I 'shooed' wandering cattle back into the pasture where they belonged.)",

I started making money by performing when I was 10 years old and eventually paid for my entire college education by doing shows for company parties and trade shows. While it’s not longer a revenue stream for me, I still have the privilege of performing a week a year at the world famous Magic Castle in Hollywood, as well as several command performances at venues in Las Vegas. I’m also faculty on what the BBC called “The world’s most prestigious magic school.” The rest of my background is in technology. My undergraduate work was in robotics. Grad school got me into statistics and modeling. My only “real job” was for Motorola, performing advanced statistical predictions for their satellite & space projects. In my spare time, I invest in real estate, train Shao-lin kung fu and travel the world with my amazing wife and friends.",

    "description": "\"Analog/Digital Signal Analysis in Physical Instrumentation and Detectors\" • In this research I built and operated threshold circuits based on a basic Schmitt- trigger design architecture which derived inputs from various physical sensors. I used an Arduino micro-controller which sent the output of the sensors to the serial port of a computer, which allowed me to store and process data from the circuits. I used various computer codes (in C) to set thresholds and conditional levels for the sensors. I used many diﬀerent sensors including; sharp infrared IR range sensors (GP2D12), LM35 analog linear temperature sensors (DFR0023), analog ambient light sensors (DFR0026), digital magnetic sensors (DFR0033), analog carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7-SEN0132), and infrared emitters and detectors. Through this research I established a strong understanding of the physical basis of electronics & circuits, micro-controller theory and operation, and analog-to- digital conversion methods.",

    "description": "\"Characterizing Thermal Noise in Astronomical Charge Coupled Devices\" • Developed methods to probe the linearity of thermal noise in the Apogee Alta charge-coupled device (CCD) at the SARA 0.9m telescope in Tuscon, AZ. Developed an understanding of the solid- state physics underlying differences between various CCD types: deep-depletion, orthogonal transfer, and multi-pinned phase CCDs etc. I implemented IDL codes to \"stack\" images and perform in-depth analysis involving dark exposures and bias frame subtractions. Determined a nonlinear trend in thermal noise generation within the system and began working on methods to reduce/account for this noise to fully exploit the CCD‘s capabilities.",
