    "description": "Travelers Insurance was a transition project as I moved from the USMC to commercial consulting services. At Travelers, I was a member of a three-person services team with responsibility to support operating systems and networking. By leveraging my previous experience with Mainframes, Novell Networks, and Personal Computers I supported the upgrade of the existing Novell network and integrated communications from OS/2 workstations to the mainframe. This project consisted of Novell server upgrades, and integration of communications over a nationwide SNA network. Additionally, I executed a network upgrade of the existing Token Ring network, standardized the installation of OS/2 workstations, and installation of Cubix remote dial in communications server. As an additional task within the team, I designed and coded three systems using VB3 and Access to support user management, asset tracking, and incident tracking.",

    "description": "I founded and owned KKCS in April 1988 with the mission to provide high quality consulting to local industries in the Albany GA area. At the peak of business, KKCS employed 15 people. KKCS had two primary practice areas, Networking and System management and Application development. The Networking and Systems management practice focused on the installation and management of Novell networks for small business. Services sold included the management of Novell networks, server maintenance and support, user account management, and disaster recovery planning. In addition to Novell, we deployed a unique solution powered by PC-MOS, which was a mult-user time slicing operating system. This system allowed the deployment of one high-end workstation, which had three remote terminals attached. The solution reduced deployment costs but still benefited from a multi-user system we developed in DBXL / Quicksilver. The application development was based on several languages including Clipper 87 & 5.0, DBXL, Quicksilver, DBase, C, and Clarion. Key systems were based on DBXL and Quicksilver, which provided multi-user database access with record locking. This capability allowed KKCS to service a large number of customers including large regional agricultural firms, local police departments, and manufacturing companies. Two systems were also generated using Clarion, which was a 4GL application generation system. Clarion was used to generate the base code, which was then modified to support specific customer requirements. Key systems created include: • Police department incident response tracking with electronic transmission to state of GA • Feed processing plan to included full inventory management, intake processing, and bulk to bag conversion systems • Aquaculture fish feeding system which included auto calculation and feedback loop for short and long term feeding schedules • Add on reporting engine for CA Accounting packages • Irrigation maintenance tracking system",

    "description": "Information Resource Management Division (IRMD) The mission of IRMD was to support the management and versioning of all applications running in production for logistics in the USMC world wide. The division managed requests for source code for modification and the re-deployment of these applications after testing. As a programmer analyst I was responsible for maintenance and improvements to the systems that supported the divisions mission. Manually creating JCL code and executing this code within ROSCOE on IBM Mainframes accomplished the bulk of work performed by the Division. I spearhead an idea and effort to automate the creation of JCL code based on a standard request form. The processing system automatically generated the JCL coded, executed the code, and processed the results all through coding the ROSCOE system. This effort resulted in many advancements including: • Eliminated 80% of the data entry • Automated 95% of the system • Reducing the average processing time from 25 – 45 minutes to less than 3 minutes • Reducing the initial response time from 15 – 20 minutes to 30 seconds • Migration to 100% paperless solution During this effort I also implemented new coding standards to insure module code design, increased productivity, and reduced maintenance cost. Additional capabilities included development of an Assembler based “wait” command that could be executed within ROSCOE.",

In this role I was responsible for the standardization of all LAN and WAN communications globally for Jabil which included designing all Global network based on Cisco, configuration of global network routing, and design of all Internet connection points. The final project completed for Jabil included the design and deployment of a global ATM network leveraging Cisco ATM equipment to provide a integrated voice and data network for all Jabil communications world wide. Other Key accomplishments included: • Designed, Implemented, and Configured all Security solutions for Internet access and business partners connections • Created standard security policies for access from Cisco Systems, Inc. networks by external vendors in the manufacturing process • Lead team in development of standardized desktops providing a constant workstation profile. Profile requirements completed: Microsoft group policies and profiles, virus protection for files being transmitted, virus protection for email services. • Performed bi-annual security review of connections between Jabil Circuits and Cisco Systems manufacturing networks and operating systems.",

At Travelers, I was a member of a three-person services team with responsibility to support operating systems and networking. By leveraging my previous experience with Mainframes, Novell Networks, and Personal Computers I supported the upgrade of the existing Novell network and integrated communications from OS/2 workstations to the mainframe. This project consisted of Novell server upgrades, and integration of communications over a nationwide SNA network. Additionally, I executed a network upgrade of the existing Token Ring network, standardized the installation of OS/2 workstations, and installation of Cubix remote dial in communications server. As an additional task within the team, I designed and coded three systems using VB3 and Access to support user management, asset tracking, and incident tracking.",

    "description": "I founded and owned KKCS in April 1988 with the mission to provide high quality consulting to local industries in the Albany GA area. At the peak of business, KKCS employed 15 people. KKCS had two primary practice areas, Networking and System management and Application development. The Networking and Systems management practice focused on the installation and management of Novell networks for small business. Services sold included the management of Novell networks, server maintenance and support, user account management, and disaster recovery planning. In addition to Novell, we deployed a unique solution powered by PC-MOS, which was a mult-user time slicing operating system. This system allowed the deployment of one high-end workstation, which had three remote terminals attached. The solution reduced deployment costs but still benefited from a multi-user system we developed in DBXL / Quicksilver. The application development was based on several languages including Clipper 87 & 5.0, DBXL, Quicksilver, DBase, C, and Clarion. Key systems were based on DBXL and Quicksilver, which provided multi-user database access with record locking. This capability allowed KKCS to service a large number of customers including large regional agricultural firms, local police departments, and manufacturing companies. Two systems were also generated using Clarion, which was a 4GL application generation system. Clarion was used to generate the base code, which was then modified to support specific customer requirements.

    "description": "Information Resource Management Division (IRMD) The mission of IRMD was to support the management and versioning of all applications running in production for logistics in the USMC world wide. The division managed requests for source code for modification and the re-deployment of these applications after testing. As a programmer analyst I was responsible for maintenance and improvements to the systems that supported the divisions mission. Manually creating JCL code and executing this code within ROSCOE on IBM Mainframes accomplished the bulk of work performed by the Division. I spearhead an idea and effort to automate the creation of JCL code based on a standard request form. The processing system automatically generated the JCL coded, executed the code, and processed the results all through coding the ROSCOE system. This effort resulted in many advancements including: • Eliminated 80% of the data entry • Automated 95% of the system • Reducing the average processing time from 25 – 45 minutes to less than 3 minutes • Reducing the initial response time from 15 – 20 minutes to 30 seconds • Migration to 100% paperless solution During this effort I also implemented new coding standards to insure module code design, increased productivity, and reduced maintenance cost. Additional capabilities included development of an Assembler based “wait” command that could be executed within ROSCOE.",

Created new program to provide Reserve Officers and Enlisted personnel from all services to augment the staff of the key network technology work centers at the Pentagon and other key Command and Control Centers throughout the world. Recruited and trained staff members and created Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for utilization of Reservists to support the prime Command, Control, and Communications Centers of the United States. Staff members served as watch team members for the primary “war rooms” of the United States, the National Military Command Center (NMCC) in the Pentagon; the Alternate NMCC at Site R. Team members also served in the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Management Center (GMC) at the Pentagon. Staff members monitored and controled the operation of the nation’s primary command and control system, GCCS, functions from widely disbursed locations from the Pentagon to various Defense Megacenters (DMCs) throughout the US using a Remedy based Virtual Help Desk System which operates over SIPRNET. Team members performed special technical projects on primary Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) networks installed throughout the world. Personally participated in numerous technical interchange meetings which defined the methodology for utilizing ATM technology to communicate to field deployed warfighters from all services over the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) through the 15 DISA Standard Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites around the world. Primary technical contributor to the technology selection and architecture methodology used for this implementation of these primary warfighting links for all combatant Commanders-in-Chiefs (CINCs). Reviewed the detailed plans with key Program Managers for transition of selected STEP sites to become DoD Teleports.",

It uses a high-speed character recognition QuickStrokes engine (also developed by Mitek) to read the mark sense, hand, and machine printed information from the scanned and faxed images. Upon correction and validation, Doctus stores the results as data that can be manipulated using any major databases or spreadsheet application. Statistical reports can be generated using the Seagate Crystal Reports engine. * Designed, implemented, and maintained the ActiveX controls for the Custom ValEdit module. The Custom ValEdit module in the Doctus system performs automatic data validation and manual data correction. It also supports flexible screen layout per form type (similar to the Microsoft Visual Studio Resource Editor). * Designed, implemented, and maintained Doctus workflow databases for Oracle and Microsoft SQL-Server 2000. * Worked on the prototype of the Custom ValEdit module as the ASP.NET based application. * Co-chaired in the Doctus technical design discussions. * Co-authored System Requirements specs (SRS), System Detailed Design specs (SDD), and Statement of Work Specs (SOW) for customized Doctus projects. * Lead a software team of 4 software engineers to successfully integrate Doctus into the InputAccel workflow system on schedule. * Used the following development tools: C, C++/MFC 6.0, Visual C++ v6.0/2003, ODBC, C#, ASP.NET v2.0, ADO.NET, Crystal Reports 8.5 SDK, Oracle v8i/9i, Oracle PL/SQL, SQL for Microsoft SQL-Server 2000, ActiveX Controls, Image Manipulation Using ImageMan DLL.",

This involved all aspects of deployment from requirements, installation, transition, training, going live and support. This work was both in Ireland and the U.K. • I was responsible for the development of the payroll software. This involved liaising with the UK developers to incorporate budget updates and system enhancements, and testing the subsequent update before release. Due to budget timing, the timescale for completion was always very tight.",
