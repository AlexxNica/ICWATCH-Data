Organized meetings, arranged for meeting space and kept communications flowing between government personnel mainly at the Starfire Optical Range (Kirtland AFB, NM) working well with contractor personnel mainly in California to produce an effective laser communication system in the future. Also organized a documents database with important information both government and contractor personnel could use when needed. 2. My other hat was to test scientific cameras for use by other projects at the Starfire Optical Range. I would research the camera and write an applicable test plan to find the camera's operating performance. Then testing would show how well the camera performed and what projects at the range could use it most effectively. Testing generally used two or three people so knowledge gained could be transferred with the camera to whatever project used it later. We would look at parameters like integration time and image clear time to see how well the camera performed. We used lab equipment including an integrating sphere, signal generator and precision light sources for our testing. I researched and purchased new equipment for the lab just after taking over to improve lab functionality and speed. Lab testing time was reduced 60% due to these purchases which made many more functions more automated and less laborious.",
