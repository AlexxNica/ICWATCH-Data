Designed the layout for all equipment (MS workstation and UNIX/Linux Servers) and workspaces within the lab, including the security, power, network, workspace, storage, inventory, and staging areas for the labs being incorporated into HIGHCASTLE. Developed and coordinated the creation of the SSP and the C&A package for the lab, which required consolidating five existing Accreditation packages. Generated initial C&A package template for the projected HIGHCASTLE field sites. Brought the lab to an operations status within eight months of start, resulting in a $13,000 savings to the government.",
