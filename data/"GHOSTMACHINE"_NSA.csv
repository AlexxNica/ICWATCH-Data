Principle Senior Systems Engineer,ManTech,"Mr. Hamlin performs the duties of a Senior Systems Engineer in support of the Ambiance Program. Provides End-to-End system engineering support for many of the AMBIANCE IC Gov Cloud and GhostMachine system deployments. He provides both internal and external consulting services in addition to providing technical guidance in the development or modification of complex software programs to enhance operating systems. He works daily alongside deployment leads not only to capture system requirements but to act as the technical advisor for many of the IC Gov Cloud and GhostMachine systems. Mr. Hamlin also acts as the technical liaison between the deployment leads, customer and other organizational technical leads. All throughout his support, Mr. Hamlin became familiar in the Cloud Computing Environment with special emphasis on how the RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), ACUMULO, NUWAVE, HADOOP, HDFS, MAP/REDUCE and Infrastructure Applications as well as Mission Applications can be tailored for each deployment to get the biggest bang for the buck. He developed CONOPS for three of the GhostMachine deployed systems. He performed technical research and analysis of various sustainment operations centers in the preparation of writing a white paper about ManTech developing a Cloud Operations Center (CLOC). The white paper illustrated how the CLOC will employ an Escalation process that is intended to keep senior leadership informed of any significant capability loss or SIGINT data loss on operational systems providing them necessary situational awareness for mission critical systems.
