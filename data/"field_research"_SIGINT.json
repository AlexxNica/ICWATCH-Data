    "description": "As the Federal Business Development Manager, I managed major initiatives and awards supporting the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) and Federal Programs. I developed strategic goals and relationships with respect to emerging customer needs, competitive positioning, requisite capabilities, and the tactical moves necessary to enable Fugro to capture opportunity in the market. Many of the programs required airborne EO, LiDAR, IfSAR and other remotely sensed phenomenology, with knowledge generated by the analysis, and exploitation of content, and derived products, and solutions to support on-shore (terrestrial), off-shore (maritime) and littoral (nearshore) requirements supported by Fugro's global capabilities. I identified and targeted leads, built customer and strategic industry relationships, while qualifying, researching, and developing business opportunities. I researched the internal and external environment in which Fugro, competitors and potential/existing clients operated, while building and maintaining a broad network of colleagues, partners and customers to share information and obtain prospects. I directed specific proposal activities, and participated in trades shows and conferences to sustain industry and client awareness of Fugro corporate services and capabilities. As the NGA Account Manager, I collaborated with colleagues on internal programs, coordinated and proactively maintained communications with the customer, participated in negotiation of contracts and contract changes, and served as liaison among project management and planning, project team, and line management, briefing NGA and Fugro Senior Management as required for capabilities, programs and target acquisitions.",

With curbside food and yard waste collection and composting facilities in the County, there is the opportunity to expand use of compost on farms. This program will conduct the applied research needed to validate use of compost on important local crops and create compost demonstration sites at up to 27 farms. Demand will be stimulated and a sustainable market created for returning waste food energy to local farms.",
