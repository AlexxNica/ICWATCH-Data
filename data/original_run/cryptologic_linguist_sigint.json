I have a passion for the game of basketball and have coached AAU, Travel, and Feeder Teams for the past four years now. Inspiring others to commit to long-term goals physically and academically to prepare them with the necessary tools to succeed in other aspects of life, not just basketball. Compassionate about teaching basketball, as a one-time player and now current coach, stressing the importance of healthy physical and mental habits is key. With a great deal of experience coaching, the awareness of each athlete’s different personality is key, and being seasoned to meet each athletes’ needs mentally and physically as players is crucial to success. One holds an impressive track record of handling and coordinating daily practice schedules, assisting in player skill development, analyzing game film, season game schedules, and conducting community service work.",
