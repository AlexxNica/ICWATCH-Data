    "description": "Ranger Proof Consulting has been an outlet for me to showcase certain tactical gear and tactical tools for use in Military and Law Enforcement duty. By using equipment in a \"hard use\", realistic environment, I am able to see what works and what does not work for specific mission requirements. I do not just evaluate gear based on limited use, I use this gear as it is intended, over a long period of time. If the piece of gear meets my high standards of performance, then I will deem it \"Ranger Proof\" and be able to recommend the equipment to the end user. Due to my involvement with Local, State and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, I have the ability to guide individuals as well as departments in gear selection as it fits their needs. By tapping into the Social Media world, I have been able to establish myself as an end user, with knowledge and history, so that when I recommend or endorse a product, the consumer can rest assured that either I have, or those I trust have used it to its limit and found that it does what it advertises. I have partnered with many companies in the firearms / tactical industry, to test and evaluate their product lines in a very hard use setting. Feedback is given, along with Social Media coverage to increase product awareness and branding. The following list are companies that I have done extensive work with: • Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) • CMC Triggers • Alamo Four Star • GPI Manufacturing • Azimuth Technologies • US Optics • Bushnell Elite • War Sport Industries • Odin Works • Stark Equipment • Delta P Design • LeHigh Defense • GemTech • Diamondback Tactical • GreyFox Industries • Skallywag Tactical",

During my attachment to the 2/104th Cavalry, I served as the Operational Management Team Chief (OMT) and supervised four, four-man Human Intelligence Collection Teams. These teams were stationed at Joint Support Sites throughout our operational area. My scope of duty included many areas of influence. I supervised and mentored the junior collectors, aiding and guiding in collection focus, interrogation strategies, questioning plans, and force multipliers to the Combatant Commanders. I also was able to handle Source Operations on and around Camp Taji. My Arabic language capabilities, allowed me to be assigned as additional duties, to the Squadron Commander, and accompany him to Key Leader Engagement Meetings. I worked hand in hand with a Language Assistant, developing questioning strategies, interrogations, and source assessment. My position also required me to manage all contingency fund reports submitted by the Collection Teams, as well as quality control on all field reporting that the Collection Teams submitted.",
