Provides End-to-End system engineering support for many of the AMBIANCE IC Gov Cloud and GhostMachine system deployments. He provides both internal and external consulting services in addition to providing technical guidance in the development or modification of complex software programs to enhance operating systems. He works daily alongside deployment leads not only to capture system requirements but to act as the technical advisor for many of the IC Gov Cloud and GhostMachine systems. Mr. Hamlin also acts as the technical liaison between the deployment leads, customer and other organizational technical leads. All throughout his support, Mr. Hamlin became familiar in the Cloud Computing Environment with special emphasis on how the RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), ACUMULO, NUWAVE, HADOOP, HDFS, MAP/REDUCE and Infrastructure Applications as well as Mission Applications can be tailored for each deployment to get the biggest bang for the buck. He developed CONOPS for three of the GhostMachine deployed systems. He performed technical research and analysis of various sustainment operations centers in the preparation of writing a white paper about ManTech developing a Cloud Operations Center (CLOC). The white paper illustrated how the CLOC will employ an Escalation process that is intended to keep senior leadership informed of any significant capability loss or SIGINT data loss on operational systems providing them necessary situational awareness for mission critical systems. Mr. Hamlin also supported the test and integration team in performing system testing, end-to-end testing, and functionality testing.",

CIS II was a $70M annual combined FFP and IDIQ contact with over 150 employees and 30 subcontracted companies. The contract managed over one million ft2 of 24 hour operational data center, office space and mechanical systems to include a dozen chilled water towers, nine emergency generators, food services, custodial, construction, logistics and ESH. Our staff provided 24/7 O&M support to all critical systems and facility support and I was responsible for interfacing with all customers and senior officials to provide the highest level of customer support and service to maintain this national asset. In 2009, the contract completed 90 IDIQ facility modification projects that varied in size from a low of $2000 to $2M in size. At the completion of the CIS contract, I was responsible for transitioning the personnel and functions onto the Consolidated Facilities Operations and Maintenance (CFOAM) contact; where LM is the major sub to Boeing on a cost plus award fee contract with 145 LM employees. The transition required leadership through a changing environment for both employees and the on-site customer. LM received an award fee score of 100% during the transition. I was the LM Site manager and deputy PM to the Boeing PM, continuing to provide the same high quality services that CIS II provide to the US Government.",

CDMA implementation is plugged right into the sub-network layer of the protocol stack. The sub-network layer will support both CDMA and GPRS radios without knowledge of which radios are on the network. Coded a front end user interface using Visual Studio .NET and C#. The interface receives messages from the Mobile Message Switch and the DIAD. Coded, tested and integrated an embedded C++ radio loader launcher on the DIAD 4. The radio loader reads the current configuration and attempts to upgrade the loader to a new configuration. Converted the existing DIAD 3 radio loader to a DIAD 4 radio loader. The version 3 loader was written in C/C++ on the PSOS platform.",

Specific accomplishments are listed belo Served as the Release Build Manager. Responsibilities included development environment support, running daily builds using a cron job (Ant task), patching software builds for maintenance releases, and component integration. Lead the design and implementation of allowing both QCC and Internet Shipping to share a user's session using Struts, Java and JSPs. This basically allowed the two applications to share data and made the site easier to use for our users. Lead the re-design efforts for the Quick Cost Calculator (QCC) in conjunction with www.ups.com site re-design. Created a schedule for QCC's redesign. The schedule spanned the entire development cycle (design, coding, testing and integration). Successfully implemented the new QCC design and the integration of the external QCC interface to the Page Generation Framework and the C-Clamp presentation layer using Struts, JSPs and Java. Mentored fellow developers on the implementation of the QCC design and the use of Model View Controller (MVC). User interaction was logged with the previously developed Reporter and Log4J. Acted as the primary interface to the Rating and Validation component (RAVE), Rating Component, Shipping Component and Internet Pickup for both QCC and IS. Performed load analysis testing using LoadRunner for QCC and the XML data provided by the reporter. XSL was used to transform the XML data into the LoadRunner tag based input. Designed, coded and tested a Reporter that collects statistics on QCC ranging from measuring time span hits to country specific queries. Framework was extended to measure real-time exceptions, servlet monitoring, and load balancing by extending Log4J. The output of the QCC reporter is in two formats, one for viewing (HTML) and one for further processing (XML).",

    "summary": "Software Engineer with an eye for cutting edge interface design and experience in rapid development environments. Experience in multiple stages of development, planning, prototyping, development for production, as well as testing and software maintenance. Adaptive to fast paced environments, quick turnarounds, and new situations/architectures. Strongly suited with the ability to bridge the gap between design and implementation. I'm an engineer who's interests lie in well designed software, both in terms of User Experience and efficiently organized code. My experience has brought challenges largely dealing with the organized display of data for the purpose of searching, management, and analysis. My latest project has brought both a challenge and opportunity to lead a small team of developers, taking a content management web portal from design to production. I'm also a devoted musician and love to share my work with anyone interested. I've played piano since age 5 and continue to make use of my talent in church and in personal projects. I'm very engaged in music production. My interests also are in photography, videography, writing, and theology.",

    "description": "Developed software for real-time spacecraft simulators, a spacecraft closed-loop ground controller, and the client side of a telemetry and command database system. Involved in all aspects of system development and delivery including customer design reviews, coding, integration testing, version control, customer witnessed qualification testing, installation, customer training, and documentation. • Designed, analyzed, and coded a fuel-efficient thruster algorithm for use in a ground based system for real-time control of a satellite. The ground controller received telemetry down from the spacecraft and sent thruster and magnetic torquer commands up to the spacecraft. Ground control system was engaged and controlled the satellite for ten months. • Responsible for the testing, version control, and final release of a real-time, PC based, spacecraft simulator. Responsible for the development, integration, and modification of various software components of the simulator. This includes the network interfaces to the ground station, the real-time models, the real-time scheduler, and the interface to the spacecraft ported flight firmware. Worked closely with firmware engineer in coordinating interface development and testing of ported firmware. • Developed simulator user interfaces for display of telemetry, scenario management, spacecraft command queuing, logging, help pages, and simulation control. Wrote utilities for simulator commanding, simulation scenario initialization, and telemetry processing. Developed a rigid body constrained motion deployment model using a recursive tree algorithm to simulated solar array and reflector deployment dynamics. • Developed a client side application to retrieve and store spacecraft telemetry and command data on an ORACLE database server. This client was part of a larger system to manage customer, and company wide distributions of the spacecraft engineering databases.",

    "description": "My first experience in the civilian sector, working as a program manager and AF SME. I was managing programs and working on proposals in bidding in areas of AF IT and NSA. After only about 7 months was handpicked to the the NETCENTS 2 Capture Manager. Building the teams to go after both the NetOps and Application Services opportunities. • Handpicked as Capture manager for the NETCENTS 2 bid, ($9B IDIQ) after only 7 months on the job—building the team and influencing the opportunity to ensure a Prime position • Business development activities within the AF in “branding” SRA as a company to be looked at and looked for in their contractual dealing. Provide access to key leaders with the AF, specifically AF/XC staff, AFCA, AMC, AETC, AFSPC and other MAJCOM A6s, the ANG, ESC, AFCYBER(P) and key leaders at 554 ELSW • Took over a troubled program and got it on track. Program needed leadership, strong direction, control and organization. Brought all these factors together and moved the program quickly from a “Yellow” to a “Green” • Diligently worked a number of RFP responses and worked as part of the team on others, lending technical and operational experience and expertise to the prop--turning tech speak into an operationally related discussion on how we would meet their mission requirements and deliver true combat capabilities",
