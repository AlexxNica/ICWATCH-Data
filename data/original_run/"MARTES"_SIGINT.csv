This information is ultimately used in preparation for upcoming Navy deployments where students learn to calculate all the information and develop briefs given to senior personnel. Used proprietary software to develop scenarios used to simulate actual area specific training for numerous worldwide hotspots. Key ELINT subject matter expert representing Navy interests in multiple course reviews, updates, and modifications. Daily supervisory tasks include: providing instruction, test and curriculum development, staff and student management, safeguarding of classified material, encouraging discipline and adherence to Navy rules and regulations, and counseling staff and students (both positive and negative).
