Internet searches include such programs as Lexus/ Nexis, Accurint, Ancestry, CLETS searches including, NAMS, DRNM(DMV Registrations), search for gun and vehicle registrations, real property title searches and utilizing other internet search sites such as Google, 411.com, and Riverside County Superior Court. I am required to testify in court. I exam legal instruments and provide direction to family who has the right to control said assets. I search the deceased residence for Wills/Trusts and preneeds. I marshall those assets that are deemed subject for loss or misappropriation.

By using equipment in a ""hard use"", realistic environment, I am able to see what works and what does not work for specific mission requirements. I do not just evaluate gear based on limited use, I use this gear as it is intended, over a long period of time. If the piece of gear meets my high standards of performance, then I will deem it ""Ranger Proof"" and be able to recommend the equipment to the end user. Due to my involvement with Local, State and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, I have the ability to guide individuals as well as departments in gear selection as it fits their needs. By tapping into the Social Media world, I have been able to establish myself as an end user, with knowledge and history, so that when I recommend or endorse a product, the consumer can rest assured that either I have, or those I trust have used it to its limit and found that it does what it advertises. I have partnered with many companies in the firearms / tactical industry, to test and evaluate their product lines in a very hard use setting. Feedback is given, along with Social Media coverage to increase product awareness and branding. The following list are companies that I have done extensive work with: • Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) • CMC Triggers • Alamo Four Star • GPI Manufacturing • Azimuth Technologies • US Optics • Bushnell Elite • War Sport Industries • Odin Works • Stark Equipment • Delta P Design • LeHigh Defense • GemTech • Diamondback Tactical • GreyFox Industries • Skallywag Tactical",0
