Owner / Founder,"Ranger Proof Consulting, Inc.","Ranger Proof Consulting has been an outlet for me to showcase certain tactical gear and tactical tools for use in Military and Law Enforcement duty. By using equipment in a ""hard use"", realistic environment, I am able to see what works and what does not work for specific mission requirements. I do not just evaluate gear based on limited use, I use this gear as it is intended, over a long period of time. If the piece of gear meets my high standards of performance, then I will deem it ""Ranger Proof"" and be able to recommend the equipment to the end user. Due to my involvement with Local, State and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, I have the ability to guide individuals as well as departments in gear selection as it fits their needs. By tapping into the Social Media world, I have been able to establish myself as an end user, with knowledge and history, so that when I recommend or endorse a product, the consumer can rest assured that either I have, or those I trust have used it to its limit and found that it does what it advertises. I have partnered with many companies in the firearms / tactical industry, to test and evaluate their product lines in a very hard use setting. Feedback is given, along with Social Media coverage to increase product awareness and branding. The following list are companies that I have done extensive work with: • Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) • CMC Triggers • Alamo Four Star • GPI Manufacturing • Azimuth Technologies • US Optics • Bushnell Elite • War Sport Industries • Odin Works • Stark Equipment • Delta P Design • LeHigh Defense • GemTech • Diamondback Tactical • GreyFox Industries • Skallywag Tactical",2011-07-01,2015-05-11,http://www.linkedin.com/,"[""Federal Law Enforcement"", ""Enforcement"", ""Counterterrorism"", ""Firearms"", ""Counterintelligence"", ""Training"", ""Certified Firearms..."", ""Defensive Tactics..."", ""SWAT Instructor"", ""Glock Armorer"", ""Weapons Consultant"", ""T&E"", ""Program Management"", ""Leadership"", ""Leadership Development"", ""Marksmanship"", ""Weapons"", ""Physical Security"", ""Intelligence"", ""Force Protection"", ""Security Clearance"", ""Tactics"", ""Special Operations"", ""Homeland Security"", ""Executive Protection"", ""Military"", ""Personnel Security"", ""Investigation"", ""HUMINT"", ""National Security"", ""DoD"", ""Personal Protection"", ""Crime Prevention"", ""Afghanistan"", ""Personal Security"", ""Combat"", ""Intelligence Analysis"", ""Criminal Investigations"", ""Security Operations"", ""Surveillance"", ""Police"", ""Pistol"", ""Public Safety"", ""Close Protection"", ""First Responder"", ""Patrol"", ""Emergency Management"", ""Criminal Justice"", ""Interrogation"", ""Law Enforcement...""]",[],"[{""language""=>""Arabic"", ""proficiency""=>nil}, {""language""=>""Spanish"", ""proficiency""=>nil}, {""language""=>""English"", ""proficiency""=>nil}]",Darren McCall,Tampa/St. Petersburg,Florida Area,Military,https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/themes/katy/ghosts/person/ghost_person_150x150_v1.png,"[{""name""=>""US Army Ranger Association"", ""start_date""=>""1991-07-01"", ""end_date""=>nil}]","[{""name""=>""ITS Tactical"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3942347&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Long Range Shooting"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4177261&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""NTOA (National Tactical Officers Association)"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4240613&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""SOT-A Association"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=5082195&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Ranger School"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=55533&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""FFL Dealer Networking"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=6624865&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""ClearedPath"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=7444366&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Special Forces Veterans"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1098397&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Law Enforcement Equipment Manufacturers"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2922143&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""Private Security For The Smaller Enterprise"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=8241515&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""TACTICAL GEAR & WEAPONS NETWORK"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3968763&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""HUMINT, Intelligence Operations, and Irregular Warfare"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2065354&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""The Intelligence Community"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1271127&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}, {""name""=>""20th SFG(A) SOT-A / SOT-B Members"", ""link""=>""http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=7458010&goback=%2Enpp_darren*5mccall%2F4%2F276%2F7aa&trk=fulpro_grplogo""}]","[{""name""=>""Various Law Enforcement Certifications"", ""description""=>""Law Enforcement Certifications -
