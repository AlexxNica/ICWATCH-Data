Qualified as Enlisted Information Dominance Warfare Specialist and subject matter expert, created three documents compiling specific target knowledge and signals analysis tools to reduce reporting time by 80%. Spearheaded the innovative environmental search of the high-frequency spectrum and directed search methods to locate, process, and break out signals of interest to report on valuable intelligence in support of the U.S. Pacific Command. Skillful with multiple SIGINT intelligence applications, software and analyst tools including Pidgin, NSAnet, Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), and open source information discovery methods. Conducted seventeen high priority SIGINT operations briefings at NSA and Intelligence Community field sites to target customers and special unit offices to expand geographic knowledge and advanced collection methods. Led the collaboration of two intelligence operations sites for new automated collection systems resulted in gathering 20,000 signals of interest and 840 special interest reports. Collected, processed, and analyzed over 31,800 SIGINT product reports providing situational awareness for units in the Pacific Area of Responsibility which greatly resulted in nearly 500 special interest reports. Maintained five multi-million dollar remote collection systems to ensure quick validation, time-sensitive reporting, and accurate geo-location in support of the U.S. pacific fleet area of responsibility. Analyzed time-critical intelligence information and produced SIGINT Threat Warning reports in support of U.S. assets in the assigned AOR. Tools used: Gale-Lite, Google Earth, Intelink, KLs, Oilstock, Intellipedia, and USSID System.",

    "summary": "I am a very down-to-earth, hard-working, professional individual with career-driven goals, an upbeat personality, and a knack for numbers. After growing up on my parents' 550+ acre Beef and Grain farm, I developed a passion for Agriculture, and a curiosity in the financial realm behind it. It is this curiosity that led me to pursue a career in Business and Accounting. To start off my college career, I attended UW-Whitewater from 2011-2014, double-majoring in Accounting and Finance. After recently transferring to Marian University in Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin, I am in my 4th year as an Accounting major working towards my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. I will be graduating in December of 2015. My ultimate career goal is to specialize in Agricultural Accounting and Financial Analyzing, but my current interests include Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Corporate Tax, and Audit. I am, however, extremely open to experience any and all opportunities that would allow me to expand my current skill-set and knowledge beyond these areas.",

    "summary": "We’ve heard the horror stories. Your favorite watch breaks, just as the warranty has run out. You take it to a department store, and after waiting for as long as a month, you get quoted an exorbitant price that’s way more than you expected. When you ask why, you’re given the ambiguous response that, on top of your requested repairs, the watch also needed additional and unspecified “service.” You get upset, you may even try to negotiate, but in the end, what else can you do? You either pay the price, or throw the watch in the garbage. At Watch Repair & Co., these types of stories make us upset. Really upset. That’s why our #1 goal is to provide speedy service at a price that won’t make your heart race. Maybe you have a watch you cherish that constantly needs repair. Maybe you just bought an incredible watch that just needs service for the first time. But just because your watch is special does not give watchmakers an excuse to rip you off. Our customers get the lowest prices and experience the highest expectations. Our jewelers and watchmakers are experts at their craft, with years of experience to draw from. Our team of expert watchmakers repairs and services almost everything: watches, jewelry, cutlery, and more. They also do engraving and polishing at a fraction of what the other guys will charge. Service is our business model. It’s the main reason we’ve been so busy and successful in this brutal economy. For us, premium service is going above and beyond to make every customer happy. We offer the highest quality skill and craftsmanship, backed by years of experience, done in a workshop full of the latest tools and technology, at a price that will make you happy. We guarantee that your watch or piece gets the VIP treatment, every time. Anything less…well, that’s just not Watch Repair & Co.",

I believe in balance; hard work and play, analysis and instinct, and tough decisions and laughter. Even though I’ve always worked upward, I believe in working deeply, too. The world is full of dichotomy, like my simultaneous love of Oxford commas and AP Style. I’ve written the news and shared it. I’ve been behind the camera and in front of it. I’ve been privileged to work in disparate industries, from stunts to sustainability. Now, I'm diving into the world of food...and loving it.",

Proposal lays groundwork for 2014 basic FMV PED architecture in Kabul. • Initiated conference planning and intelligence exchange meetings which resulted in NGA’s GEOINT kinetic and non-kinetic targeting efforts being highly productive in discussions between services, allies, and Intelligence Community (IC) targeting experts. • Recognized by NGA Director for an Intelligence Citation as an active volunteer of NGA’s Crisis Action Team during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.
